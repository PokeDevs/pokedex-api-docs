# Introduction

The entire Pokédex data in one place and easily accessible through RESTful API! We’ve covered every Pokémon and we will always try to keep this up-to-date.

Here you’ll find documentation on how to use our Pokédex API and any other information regarding the same.

All of our [documentation is available on GitHub](https://github.com/PokeDevs/pokedex-api-docs) and we would ❤ corrections and improvements!



Looking forward to see you make awesome apps using our API!
